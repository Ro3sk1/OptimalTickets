## What's Optimal Tickets?

Optimal Tickets is a **free Discord BOT** created to help you. It not only  can create, claim and transfer tickets, but it also can show you server and user info, and much more.

## Setup the BOT
To setup the bot, you first need to invite it to your server. **[Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=621346592309379082&permissions=8&scope=bot)** to invite it.
After that, you'll need to do: 
`!ticket-setup [@channel] [Name Of Category where all tickets will be]`
*Example: `!ticket-setup #ðŸ“‘ã€¡ticket SUPPORT`*   ->  __You can leave the 2nd part blank, and it will create a category called "Tickets".__

Then, to get pinged when a ticket is created, you'll need to do:
`!support-role [@role]`
*Example: `!support-role @Support`*

## Claim and transfer Tickets
After a TICKET is created, you should claim the ticket. To do that, simply do:
`!claim`

If you need to transfer the ticket to other person, or to youself, do:
`!transfer [@member]`*   ->  __Leave the [@member] part blank if you want to transfer the ticket to yourself.__
